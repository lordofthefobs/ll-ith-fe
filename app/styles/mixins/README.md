# Mixins

Within the `mixins` directory there are two files that can be used in a given project - `_mixins.scss`
and `_mixins_styles.scss`. The first file will contain UI actions such as animations, but no styling.
The `_mixins_styles.scss` is reserved for any mixins relating to style. If either of these are not
needed in a project they can have their imports omitted from `app.scss` and be removed from project.
